In this project, covid 19 data set has been used for data exploration and analysis of the given dataset. 
The data consist of covid- 19 deaths as per geographical locations (country, continent) and covid-19 vaccinations rates collected in two separate tables.
The data set is analysed by setting up various criterias through SQL queries and tried to derive useful insights such as:

1. Looking at countries with highest infection rate compared to population
2. To show the countries having highest death count.
3. To show the continents having highest death count.
4. Looking at countries with highest cases coompared to population.
5. Global Numbers all over the world
6. Comparision b/w total cases vs vaccinations.
Using CTE to access the data more easily and applying joins to combine the data from multiple tables for easy accessibility.
