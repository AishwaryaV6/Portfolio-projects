AIM: To build a dashboard that depicts inflow of patients in specific departments (orthopaedics), wait time across age-group and patietnt's service rating.

OBJECTIVES: 1. To estimate number of the patients in the orthopaedics department.
 2. To understand the average patient satisfaction score.
 3. To estomate the avergae wait time of the patients on varioud working days.

 PROCESS: Step 1: First the orthopaedics department data is separated from the main data set.
 Step 2: Set uo pivot tables for specific KPIs such as :
 1. Patient Satisfaction Score per month.
 2. Age bracket of patients visited at different days.
 3. Number of patients visited at various time slots and the wait time.

    Step 3: Creating a dashboard that covers the various KPIs which can be calibrated using the two slicers:-

    1. Day_of_the Week
    2. Month
   
       The main business problems that has been tried to address:-

       1. What was out average patient score?

          The depicted values in the pivot tables gives an idea of the number of patients through out the days of the week and how it has effected the patient satisfaction score.

          Inference: The number of patients visited do not have a direct impact on the patient satisfaction score because there are days where even when the number of patients are less
           the high patietn satisfaction score has been attained where days even when the inflow is good the rating was not collected and hence not recorded in the data.

      2. How many patients were there in each age bracket?

         The coloumn chart gelps to understand the foot fall of patients falling under various age brackets.
         
          Inference: It has been found that the patients falling in the age bracket of 1-10 is maximum in number.
     
     3. Is there a relation between the wait time and number of patients?
        The combo chart where the bars represent the time slots and the line graph represents the number of patients have tries to analyse the correlatiopn between these thwo KPIs.

        Findings: It has been infered from the combo chart representation that the time lsots that faces the maximum number of patient inflow are:-
        i)The maximum number of patient inflow was faced during the time slot 9.00-9.59AM but it is not hte time where we can see the maximum amount of wait time.
        ii)The least number of patients seen were in 11.00-11.59AM but the wait time is more than 30 mins.

        Inference: The time slots where the patient in-flow is low but the wait time is high might be facing othere factors that slows down the process.
        eg:- Factors such as availability of staff during these time slots has to be investigated and the shifts they are currently at,
        to understand if their ovr worked shift timin g have an influence.
